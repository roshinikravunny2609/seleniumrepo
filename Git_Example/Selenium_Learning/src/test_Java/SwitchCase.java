//object oriented language: means memory allocation happens to an obj and the memory gets released wen the obj is not in use
//object has both physical structure (prop) and logical properties
//In java, object is an entity which has both state and behavior
//state is value or variable
//behaviour is the functions that we use
//class is a set of objects
//public static void main is an object -default obj for running a class

//inheritance ---class A class B Java doesnt have multiple inheritance
//has multi level
//access modifiers : permission to access the methods. public, private, protected
//encapsulation - when u declare a method as private and call that private method in another public method and access it.
//protected -- cant be accessed outside the package
//public - access in the same class, same package, outside the package
//private - access in the same class, same package and outside the package through encapsulation
//protected -- access in the same class, same package
//static - cant be changed
//public static void main - this main cant be called anywhere else
//global variable, local variable
//void -- returns null
//collections - memory expands and contracts acc to the program
//List,Set,Map,Queue
//insert, update, delete
//List can store duplicate value
//Set can store only unique value
//Map - key value pair
//queue - first in - first out
//array List ,Linked List, Double linked list
//Set - Hash set, Tree set
// Map-- Hash Map, Tree map - duplicate value allowed, but key not allowed
// List is interface , ArrayList - class
